This project uses data from the Kenya Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) 2022, obtained through the DHS Program

Important:

The DHS datasets are not publicly redistributable.

To access the raw data, you must register and submit a request directly through the [DHS Program Data Portal](https://dhsprogram.com/data/)
- Approval is granted by the DHS Program, and data use is subject to their terms and conditions.
- This repository therefore does not include any DHS raw data files (such as .SAS7BDAT, .dta, .sav, .csv, or .map).
- Only analysis scripts, documentation, and selected aggregated or derived outputs are provided here.
